# final-project

In my final project, I made a two player game of pong. The game goes up to
five goals, and there are special buttons on the menu screen that can change the
speed of the game if wanted by the players. The two players play on the same
keyboard, and the players are notified of winners. In the game, the collision
angles from the ball off the paddle were similar to that of a perfect elastic
collision with the exception being that each time the ball hits a paddle, it
speeds up ever so slightly. That way, the bounce angles are more interesting,
and the game gets more challenging over time. As far as mobile-responsiveness,
the canvas in which the players play the game can adapt to window size. While
the game itself would be hard to play on extremely small devices, the code will
simply shrink the canvas down according to the size of the window.
